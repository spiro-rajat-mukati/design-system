# Figma library structure

The Figma file mirrors the code library one-to-one. If a thing exists in Storybook, it exists in this Figma file in the same shape, with the same name, consuming the same tokens.

## File

- **Name:** `Design System Library`
- **Team:** the design team's shared team (not personal space).
- **Permissions:** Library admins (design lead + eng lead) edit; everyone else views.
- **Branching:** Use Figma Branching for any change beyond a single token tweak. Merge requests get the same two-lead review as code PRs.

## Pages

In this exact order, top to bottom:

```

Emoji prefixes are functional — Figma's page picker is much faster to scan with them.

## Cover page

A 1440 × 1024 frame with:

- Library name + version (`Design System Library · v0.1.0` — keep in sync with `package.json`)
- One-line purpose
- Last-updated date (manually update on publish)
- Links to: Storybook URL, GitHub repo, Slack channel
- A dual preview of one component (the Button) in light and dark, so anyone opening the file immediately understands what the modes do. (Any legacy Figma modes are reconciled by the DesignSync plugin.)

## Foundations pages

Each foundations page is a visual reference, **never** the source of truth. The source is `packages/tokens/source/*.json`. These pages exist so designers and stakeholders can see what's available.

### Color

Three sections, each a horizontal swatch grid:

- **Primitives** — one row per family (`neutral`, `brand`, `info`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`), 11 stops each. Each swatch shows its hex + variable name.
- **Semantic — light** — surface, text, border, action × {primary, secondary, tertiary, destructive}, feedback × {info, success, warning, danger}. Each tile shows the swatch + variable name + what primitive it resolves to.
- **Semantic — dark** — same grid, but the frame uses the Dark mode of the Variable Collection. (Two stacked frames are clearer than one frame with mode-toggle commentary.)

### Typography

One frame per role (`display-l/m/s`, `heading-1`–`6`, `body-l/m/s`, `label-l/m/s`, `caption`, `code`, `overline`). Each frame:

- Renders sample text with the role's tokens applied (size, line, weight)
- Shows the variable name and resolved values to the right

### Spacing

Visual ramp — for each `space-*` token, a horizontal bar of that width with the variable name underneath. Plus a separate "spacing roles" block showing `inset`, `stack`, `inline` semantic groupings.

### Radius & Shadow

Two columns. Left: 8 squares with progressively larger radii, labelled. Right: 6 cards with progressively larger shadows, labelled.

### Motion

Three rows of animated dots (or static if Figma can't preview easily) showing each duration × ease combination. This page is mostly text — animation is hard to convey statically.

## Components pages

One page per component. **Page name matches the component file name** in code (`Button`, `ButtonGroup`, `Field`, etc.) so the link between Figma and code is unambiguous.

Each component page is laid out as:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Component name (heading-2)                 │
│  One-line purpose (body-m)                  │
│                                             │
│  ┌── Anatomy ──────────────────────┐       │
│  │  Labelled diagram of parts      │       │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘       │
│                                             │
│  ┌── Component (the master) ───────┐       │
│  │  Variants × Sizes × States      │       │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘       │
│                                             │
│  ┌── Usage ────────────────────────┐       │
│  │  Do / Don't pairs               │       │
│  └─────────────────────────────────┘       │
│                                             │
│  ┌── In context ──────────────────┐        │
│  │  Realistic use case mockup     │        │
│  └────────────────────────────────┘        │
│                                             │
│  Tokens consumed: list                      │
│  Storybook: link                            │
│  Spec: link to ComponentName.md             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The **Component** block contains the actual Figma Component (the thing that gets published). Everything else is documentation around it. See `COMPONENT-CHECKLIST.md` for what variants must exist per component.

## Patterns page

For now, a stub with three placeholders: `Sign-in form`, `Settings panel`, `Empty state card`. Patterns get built once we have real product surfaces to reference.

## Changelog page

Reverse-chronological list of meaningful changes. Each entry:

- Date
- Component(s) affected
- One-sentence description
- Link to GitHub PR

This is the design-side complement to `CHANGELOG.md`. Designers update it on publish; the PR description from `main` goes here.

## Naming conventions

- **Pages:** as listed above. Don't rename without coordinating with the eng lead.
- **Component (master):** `Button` — exact match with the React component name.
- **Variants properties:** `variant`, `size`, `state` (lowercase, single word). Use Figma's variant property syntax — they show up cleanly in the panel. (Density is mobile-only and not a web variant property.)
- **Variant values:** match the TypeScript prop values exactly (`primary`, `sm`, `hover`). No spaces, no capitalisation differences.
- **Frames:** named `Component / Use case` (e.g., `Button / In a form`, `Button / In a toolbar`).

## Publishing

- Library is published from the file's settings panel by a library admin.
- After publish, write a one-line entry on the Changelog page.
- Bump the version on the Cover page if it's a meaningful release.

## What lives in code, not Figma

These exist in code only and don't need Figma representation:

- The token build script and CI guards
- Component implementation details (refs, props, event handlers)
- The Popover internal primitive (it's not a published component — only used by Select / MultiSelect / Menu)

Conversely, **everything visual** in code must have a Figma counterpart. If a component ships in code without a Figma component, it's a half-shipped feature.
